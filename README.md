# Android Nano Degree Projects - 2016

This repository is a collation of my project work submissions to complete the 2016 Android Nano Degree qualification offered by Google and Udacity - [https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801).

My style and approach to Android development has morphed somewhat since this course work was done, and it is also likely that some of the projects are a little old technically, however I'll keep them public in GitHub in case any snippets of them are useful to anyone.
